# healthMonitoring
By looking at current pandemic situation , this tool would really for patient to stay at home and isolate themselves without going to doctor  by just connecting a device to them which would track  SPo2 level, temperature, BP, Pulse Rate and monitor patient health in a graphical view either from mobile by installing an app or by hitting an url from browser.  An IOT device that is connected to patient and this data can be analyzed the doctors and the patients family to track the patients SPo2 level, temperature, BP, Pulse Rate . This data is pushed to Cloud from iot device and the Application Service would connect to the cloud to read this data from  a topic and push it into Kafka into a topic. Kafka would streamline the data and push it inot HDFS . A Spar Streamer would read the realtime data from HDFS for analytics for Doctor.
